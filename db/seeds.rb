  and making our way out east and ending at Strange Fellows with some other stops inbetween. Theres lots
  see and drink inbetween so it should take around 4 hours. It would be ideal to ride on bikes from one place
  to another. If you don\'t own a bike there are lots of bike rental places around Yaletown you could rent
  one for the day. Please message me on here if you have any other questions. I look forward to many new

  we can think of. I am not much for organized sports teams but would love to have a diversity of things to play
  and people to play with. With summer fast approaching I am sure we could change location to English bay
  if anyone really wants to. Let me know on here if anyone has any other ideas for this casual rec sports team.
